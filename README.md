# Time course of COVID-19 epidemiological characteristics by country

#### [https://alexkychen.shinyapps.io/covid19](https://alexkychen.shinyapps.io/covid19)

This app is developed to help understand how 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infect human population in different countries over time. COVID-19 data are collected and updated by Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering ([Github repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)). Country population size is based on [2019 stats](https://worldpopulationreview.com/). 

Table
Country | Population size | Total confirmed cases | Prevalence rate | Deaths | Fatality rate | R-nought

Definition of term:
Prevalence rate = (total confirmed cases - recovered cases) / (population size*0.00001)
Fatality rate = deaths / total confirmed cases
R-nought = new cases of that day / (total confirmed cases of previous day - recovered cases of previous day)
