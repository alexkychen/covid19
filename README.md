This app is developed to help understand how 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infect human population in different countries over time. COVID-19 data are collected and updated by Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering ([JHU CSSE Github repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)). Country population size is based on [2019 stats](https://worldpopulationreview.com/). 

## What information does it show?

### A table including the following information as of selected end date

- Country
- Population size (x 1,000,000 people)
- Confirmed cases (accumulative confirmed cases)
- Prevalence rate  = (accumulative confirmed cases - accumulative recovered cases) / million people 
- Deaths (accumulative deaths)
- Fatality rate = (accumulative deaths / accumulative confirmed cases) * 100%

### Multiple time series plots of selected countries and date range 

- Accumulative confirmed cases over time
- Prevalence rate over time
- Number of accumulative deaths over time
- New confirmed cases of each day over time
