### [https://alexkychen.shinyapps.io/covid19](https://alexkychen.shinyapps.io/covid19)

This app is developed to help understand how 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infect human population in different countries over time. COVID-19 data are collected and updated by Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering ([Github repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)). Country population size is based on [2019 stats](https://worldpopulationreview.com/). 

## What information does it show

### A table including the following information as of selected end date

- Country
- Population size (unit in 100,000 people)
- Confirmed cases (accumulated confirmed cases)
- Prevalence rate ( = (total confirmed cases - recovered cases) / (population size * 0.00001) )
- Deaths (accumulated deaths)
- Fatality rate ( = accumulated deaths / accumulated confirmed cases )

### Multiple time series plots of selected countries and date range 

- Accumulated confirmed cases over time
- Prevalence rate over time
- Number of deaths (accumulated) over time
- New confirmed cases of each day over time
